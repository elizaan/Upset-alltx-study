# Introduction

Welcome to our study!

In this study, you will encounter questions about **data visualizations and equivalent text describing the content** of data visualizations. We will use UpSet plots, a set visualization technique similar to Venn diagrams as an example. 



Our research aims to **make data visualizations more accessible to people with visual impairments** such as low vision, residual vision, or no vision.  We want to understand whether text can convey equal amounts of informations as a chart. 

We first will introduce what an UpSet plot is, why is it used, how you can interpret an UpSet plot.

To ensure you are comfortable with the actual question-answer session, there will be a training section where you will have up to **three attempts** to answer the questions correctly. If all three attempts are unsuccessful, **you will be redirected to the finish page**.
